[interviewer]: Hi Sharon, thank you for joining us today. Could you start by telling me about your experience as
  a backend developer and what you've been working on recently?

  [candidate]: Thank you for having me! I've been working as a backend developer for the past 4 years, primarily
  focused on Python and API development. At Innovation Labs, I've been leading the design and implementation of our
   core backend systems. Most recently, I architected a microservices-based system that handles over 10,000
  requests per second. We migrated from a monolithic architecture, which was quite challenging but resulted in much
   better scalability and maintainability.

  [interviewer]: That's impressive scale. Can you walk me through the architecture decisions you made for handling
  10K requests per second?

  [candidate]: Absolutely. The key was breaking down our monolith into smaller, focused microservices. We used
  Python with FastAPI for the services, which gave us excellent performance with async capabilities. For the data
  layer, we implemented a combination of PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for document storage. We
  also used Redis for caching frequently accessed data. The services communicate through a message queue - we chose
   RabbitMQ for reliability. Everything runs in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes on AWS EKS, which
  allows us to auto-scale based on load.

  [interviewer]: How did you handle authentication and authorization across these microservices?

  [candidate]: Security was a top priority. We implemented a centralized authentication service using JWT tokens
  with OAuth 2.0. Each microservice validates tokens using a shared public key, so we don't need to make calls to
  the auth service for every request. For authorization, we use a role-based access control system with
  fine-grained permissions stored in PostgreSQL. We also implemented API rate limiting per user and IP address to
  prevent abuse, and all inter-service communication happens over TLS within our VPC.

  [interviewer]: Tell me about a particularly challenging technical problem you've solved recently.

  [candidate]: One of our biggest challenges was dealing with database connection pooling issues under high load.
  We were seeing connection timeouts and degraded performance during peak hours. After extensive profiling, I
  discovered our connection pools were being exhausted due to long-running queries in one of our services. I
  implemented several solutions: First, I optimized the slow queries using proper indexing and query restructuring.
   Second, I implemented a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures. Third, I set up read replicas for
   read-heavy operations and implemented smart query routing. This reduced our p99 latency by 70% and eliminated
  the timeout issues.

  [interviewer]: How do you approach testing in a microservices architecture?

  [candidate]: Testing in microservices requires a multi-layered approach. At the unit level, I write extensive
  tests for business logic using pytest, aiming for at least 80% coverage. For integration testing, I use Docker
  Compose to spin up dependent services and test interactions. We also have contract tests using Pact to ensure
  services maintain their API contracts. For end-to-end testing, we have a staging environment that mirrors
  production where we run automated test suites. I'm also a big advocate for monitoring in production - we use
  Prometheus and Grafana for metrics, and structured logging with ELK stack for debugging issues.

  [interviewer]: You mentioned using GraphQL in your skills. How have you implemented it and what benefits did it
  provide?

  [candidate]: We introduced GraphQL as an API gateway layer on top of our REST microservices about a year ago. I
  used Apollo Server with Python's Graphene library. The main benefit was reducing over-fetching and under-fetching
   of data - mobile clients could request exactly what they needed in a single query. We also implemented
  DataLoader to solve the N+1 query problem. One challenge was managing query complexity - we had to implement
  query depth limiting and cost analysis to prevent expensive queries from overwhelming our backend. Overall, it
  reduced our API calls by about 40% and significantly improved mobile app performance.

  [interviewer]: How do you ensure your backend systems are scalable and maintainable?

  [candidate]: Scalability starts with good architecture. I follow microservices principles - services should be
  loosely coupled and highly cohesive. Each service owns its data and communicates through well-defined APIs. For
  maintainability, I'm strict about code quality - we use Black for formatting, pylint for linting, and mypy for
  type checking. I write comprehensive documentation and ensure every API endpoint has OpenAPI specs. We also
  practice infrastructure as code using Terraform, so our entire infrastructure is version controlled and
  reproducible. Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions help maintain quality and share knowledge across
   the team.

  [interviewer]: What's your experience with AWS services beyond EKS?

  [candidate]: I've worked extensively with AWS services. For compute, besides EKS, I've used Lambda for
  event-driven functions and EC2 for specific workloads. For storage, S3 for object storage with lifecycle
  policies, and EBS for persistent volumes. I've set up RDS instances for PostgreSQL with automated backups and
  read replicas. For messaging, I've used SQS for queuing and SNS for pub/sub patterns. I've also worked with API
  Gateway, CloudWatch for monitoring, and IAM for fine-grained access control. Recently, I've been exploring AWS
  AppSync for real-time features. I always follow the principle of least privilege and use VPCs with proper
  security groups to isolate resources.

  [interviewer]: How do you handle database migrations in a production environment?

  [candidate]: Database migrations in production require careful planning. I use Alembic for Python projects to
  manage schema versions. Every migration is reversible, and I always test rollbacks. For zero-downtime
  deployments, I follow the expand-contract pattern - first deploy code that works with both old and new schemas,
  then run the migration, then deploy code that only uses the new schema. For large data migrations, I implement
  them in batches with progress tracking to avoid locking tables. We also have automated backup procedures before
  any migration, and I always run migrations in staging first with production-like data volumes.

  [interviewer]: What interests you about this Senior Backend Developer position?

  [candidate]: I'm excited about the opportunity to work on distributed systems at an even larger scale. Your focus
   on real-time data processing and event-driven architecture aligns perfectly with where I want to grow my
  expertise. I'm particularly interested in the challenges of handling millions of events per day that you
  mentioned in the job description. Also, the opportunity to mentor junior developers appeals to me - I believe in
  giving back and helping others grow. The tech stack you're using, especially Kafka for streaming and Kubernetes
  for orchestration, matches my experience while also offering new challenges. I'm ready to take on more
  architectural responsibilities and contribute to strategic technical decisions.

  [interviewer]: Do you have any questions for me about the role or the team?

  [candidate]: Yes, I have several questions. First, can you tell me more about the current architecture and any
  pain points you're looking to address? Second, what's the team structure - how many backend developers, and how
  do you organize work? Third, what's your deployment process like - how often do you deploy to production? Fourth,
   what are the biggest technical challenges the team is facing right now? And finally, what opportunities are
  there for learning and professional development, such as conferences or training?
