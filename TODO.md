### Strategic Decision - July 22, 2025
**Removed 14-day trial language** - Following the successful startup playbook:
- Give users full access for free initially
- Focus on user growth over early monetization
- Learn what features users actually value
- Implement pricing only after product-market fit
- Current approach: "Start free" with no restrictions

This reduces friction and accelerates user acquisition at this critical early stage.
