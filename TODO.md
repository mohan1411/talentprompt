  - Root Cause: Using substring matching instead of word boundaries
  - Solution: Implemented regex word boundary matching to prevent false matches
  - Result: Query now correctly extracts only ['python', 'aws'] without the erroneous 'r'

- ‚úÖ **Implemented 5-Tier Ranking System**
  - **Tier 1** (Score ~1.0): Perfect match - has ALL required skills
  - **Tier 2** (Score ~0.6-0.8): Has primary skill + most secondary skills (75%+)
  - **Tier 3** (Score ~0.4-0.5): Has primary skill only
  - **Tier 4** (Score ~0.15-0.2): Has secondary skills only
  - **Tier 5** (Score ~0.05): No matching skills

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Skill-Based Prioritization**
  - Problem: William Alves (AWS only) was ranking #1 for "Senior Python Developer with AWS"
  - Solution: Implemented primary skill identification and weighted scoring
  - Changes:
    - Query parser now identifies primary skill (first mentioned or in role)
    - Primary skill gets 50% weight in scoring
    - Candidates with primary skill always rank above those without
  - Result: Python developers now correctly rank above AWS-only candidates

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Search Results**
  - Added skill match details to results (matched_skills, has_primary_skill, skill_tier)
  - Improved logging for search quality monitoring
  - Created comprehensive test scripts for validation

**Test Results:**
- Before: William Alves (AWS only) ranked #1
- After: William Alves now ranks #6, with all Python developers ranking above him
- Verified with 100-resume dataset that skill-based filtering works correctly

**Scripts Created:**
