# Typo Correction Fix for Mind Reader Search

## Issue
When searching for "Senior Python Developer with AMS", the system correctly identified and corrected "AMS" to "AWS", but the GPT4 analyzer was still analyzing the original query with "AMS", resulting in:
- "Nice to have:" showing "AMS" instead of AWS-related skills
- Missing AWS-related secondary skills like Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

## Root Cause
The GPT4 analyzer was being called with the original query instead of the corrected query.

```python
# Before (incorrect):
gpt4_analysis = await gpt4_analyzer.analyze_query(query)  # Uses original "AMS"

# After (correct):
query_for_analysis = parsed_query.get("corrected_query", query)
gpt4_analysis = await gpt4_analyzer.analyze_query(query_for_analysis)  # Uses corrected "AWS"
```

## Solution Implemented

Updated `/backend/app/services/progressive_search.py`:

1. **Use corrected query for GPT4 analysis**:
   ```python
   # Use corrected query if available, otherwise use original query
   query_for_analysis = parsed_query.get("corrected_query", query)
   gpt4_analysis = await gpt4_analyzer.analyze_query(query_for_analysis)
   ```

2. **Fixed query tracking**:
   ```python
   "corrected_query": parsed_query.get("corrected_query") if parsed_query.get("corrected_query") != query else None,
   "original_query": query if parsed_query.get("corrected_query") else None
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Query: "Senior Python Developer with AMS"

**Before Fix:**
- Auto-corrected: ✓ (shows correction)
- Looking for: Python, aws ✓
- Nice to have: **AMS** ✗ (incorrect)
- Also considering: (generic skills)

**After Fix:**
- Auto-corrected: ✓ (shows correction)
- Looking for: Python, aws ✓
- Nice to have: **Docker, Linux, DevOps** ✓ (AWS-related skills)
- Also considering: Git, CloudFormation, Lambda, etc.

## How It Works Now

1. User types: "Senior Python Developer with AMS"
2. Async query parser corrects: "AMS" → "AWS"
3. GPT4 analyzer receives: "Senior Python Developer with AWS"
4. GPT4 returns AWS-related skills:
   - Secondary: Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, DevOps
   - Implied: CloudFormation, Lambda, S3, EC2, etc.

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Search for queries with typos:
   - "Python Developer with AMS" → Should show AWS skills
   - "Javscript developer" → Should show JavaScript skills
   - "Kubernets engineer" → Should show Kubernetes skills
2. Check that:
   - Correction message appears
   - Skills match the corrected term, not the typo

## Technical Notes

- The typo correction happens in the async_query_parser
- The corrected query is now properly passed to GPT4 analyzer
- Original query is preserved for showing the correction message
- Backend has been restarted to apply changes
