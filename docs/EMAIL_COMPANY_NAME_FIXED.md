# Email Format - Company Name Fixed

## Final Fix Applied

Changed all instances of "our company" to "Promtitude" when company name is not available.

### Before:
- "Mohan Gangahanumaiah from **our company** would like to invite..."
- Subject: "Invitation to Submit Your Profile - **Career Opportunity**"

### After:
- "Mohan Gangahanumaiah from **Promtitude** would like to invite..."
- Subject: "Invitation to Submit Your Profile - **Promtitude**"

## Expected Email Output

```
================================================== MOCK EMAIL ==================================================
TO: suresh@example.com
SUBJECT: Invitation to Submit Your Profile - Promtitude
FROM: Promtitude Team <noreply@promtitude.com>

TEXT CONTENT:

## Why This Happens

The recruiter (Mohan Gangahanumaiah) doesn't have a company name set in their user profile. The system now defaults to "Promtitude" instead of generic text.

## To Set Company Name

The recruiter can update their profile to include their company name, and it will automatically appear in all future submission emails.

## Summary of All Email Fixes

2. ✅ **Candidate name**: Intelligently extracted from email when not provided
