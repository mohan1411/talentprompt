## What Was Fixed

1. **Frontend Message Templates**:
   - Removed "Hi there," from new candidate message
   - Removed "Hi [Name]," from update message
   - Messages now contain only the body content

2. **Backend Email Service**:
   - Adds proper greeting "Hello [Name]," at the start
   - Includes introduction line: "[Recruiter] from [Company] would like to..."
   - Then includes the custom message
   - Consistent format for both text and HTML versions

3. **Name Extraction**:
   - Uses candidate's first and last name if available
   - Falls back to extracting from email (suresh@example.com → "Suresh")
   - Properly capitalizes names

4. **Company Handling**:
   - Shows actual company name when available
   - Defaults to "Promtitude" instead of generic text

## Email Structure

1. **Greeting**: "Hello [Name],"
2. **Introduction**: "[Recruiter] from [Company] has requested/would like to invite..."
3. **Custom Message**: The personalized message from the recruiter
4. **Call to Action**: Clear submission link
5. **Expiration**: Link validity period
6. **Sign-off**: "Best regards, [Recruiter Name], [Company]"

The email content is now consistent, professional, and properly personalized without any duplicate greetings or generic placeholders.
