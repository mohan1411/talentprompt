### LinkedIn Strategy

**Posting Schedule**: 3x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)

1. **Educational**: How-to guides for recruiters
2. **Story**: Your journey building Promtitude
3. **Data**: Industry insights with visuals

**Template for Viral LinkedIn Post**:
```
I spent 10 years in recruiting.

The worst part? Searching through 1000s of resumes to find ONE good candidate.

So I built an AI that understands what you're actually looking for.

Instead of complex boolean searches like:
("Senior" OR "Lead") AND "Python" AND ("AWS" OR "Azure") NOT "Junior"

You just type:
"Find me a senior Python developer who knows cloud"

The results? 
✅ 90% faster search
✅ 3x more relevant results
✅ Hidden gems you'd miss otherwise

Here's how it works:
[Include carousel or video]

We're in beta with 50 recruiters saving 10+ hours per week.

Comment "AI" if you want early access 👇
```

### Reddit Strategy

**Target Subreddits**:
- r/recruiting (285k members)
- r/humanresources (445k members)
- r/startups (1.5M members)
- r/Entrepreneur (1.2M members)
- r/SaaS (85k members)

**Approach**:
1. **Give value first** - Answer questions
2. **Share insights** - Not promotions
3. **Be authentic** - Share failures too
4. **Follow 9:1 rule** - 9 helpful comments per 1 mention of your product
