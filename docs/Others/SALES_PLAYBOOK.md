# Promtitude Sales Playbook 💰

## Self-Serve Sales Philosophy

As a solo founder, your product must sell itself. Every interaction should guide users toward value, then naturally toward payment. This playbook shows you how.

## 🎯 Sales Without Salespeople

### Core Principles

1. **Product as Salesperson** - Features demonstrate value
2. **Education over Persuasion** - Teach, don't pitch

5. **Data Drives Decisions** - Track everything
