## 📋 LinkedIn ToS Key Requirements

### 1. Data Collection and Use
LinkedIn's ToS requires that:
- Users must have legitimate access to the profiles they view
- Data collection must be for lawful purposes
- No selling or redistributing LinkedIn data
- Respect member privacy settings

### 2. Automation and Scraping

## ✅ How Promtitude Complies

### 1. User-Initiated Actions Only

**Our Implementation:**
```javascript
// Every import requires explicit user action
importButton.addEventListener('click', async function() {
  // User must click button for each profile
  // No automated or background imports
});
```

**Compliance Points:**
- ✅ Each profile import requires manual click
- ✅ No automated crawling or mass extraction
- ✅ User must navigate to each profile individually
- ✅ Extension only activates on user command

### 2. Respecting LinkedIn's Platform

**Technical Implementation:**
- We use standard DOM queries, not bypassing any security
- We don't modify LinkedIn's functionality
- We don't hide or alter LinkedIn's interface
- We respect LinkedIn's rate limiting

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// We only read publicly visible data
const name = document.querySelector('.pv-top-card--list li:first-child')?.innerText;
const title = document.querySelector('.pv-top-card--list li:nth-child(2)')?.innerText;
// Not accessing any hidden or protected data
```

### 3. Data Privacy and Security

**Our Measures:**
- ✅ Data transmitted securely via HTTPS
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Data stored in user's own account only
- ✅ No sharing between users
- ✅ GDPR compliant data handling

**Privacy Implementation:**
```javascript
// User-specific data isolation
const profileData = {
  ...extractedData,
  user_id: currentUser.id, // Data linked to specific user
  imported_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  source: 'linkedin_manual_import'
};
```
