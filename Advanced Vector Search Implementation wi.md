Advanced Vector Search Implementation with NLP
Objective: Design and implement a production-ready vector search system that leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques for semantic similarity matching, with sub-linear search performance and high accuracy.
Core Requirements:

Embedding Generation Pipeline

Implement multi-model ensemble approach using:

Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for general-purpose embeddings
Domain-specific fine-tuned models (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2)
Support for multilingual embeddings (XLM-RoBERTa)


Dynamic dimension reduction using PCA/UMAP while preserving semantic information
Implement embedding caching with TTL for frequently queried items


Advanced Indexing Strategy

Implement Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs for approximate nearest neighbor search
Configure with:

M=16-32 (number of bi-directional links)
ef_construction=200 (size of dynamic candidate list)
ef_search=50-100 (search parameter)


Support for:

Incremental index updates without full rebuild
Multiple distance metrics (cosine, L2, inner product)
Quantization techniques (PQ, SQ) for memory optimization




Hybrid Search Architecture

Combine dense vector search with sparse retrieval (BM25/TF-IDF)
Implement late fusion with learnable weights:
final_score = α * vector_score + β * keyword_score + γ * metadata_boost

Support filtered vector search using metadata pre-filtering


Query Processing Pipeline

Query expansion using:

Synonym detection
Named entity recognition
Query intent classification


Implement query-document interaction features
Support for multi-vector queries (e.g., title + content embeddings)


Re-ranking and Optimization

Implement two-stage retrieval:

Stage 1: Retrieve top-k candidates using ANN
Stage 2: Re-rank using cross-encoder models


Diversity-aware ranking to reduce redundancy
Learning-to-rank integration for personalized results


Performance Requirements

Query latency: <100ms for 95th percentile
Index building: Support for 10M+ vectors
Memory efficiency: Use mmap for large indices
Implement result caching with semantic similarity keys


Advanced Features

Negative sampling: Handle "NOT" queries and exclusions
Temporal decay: Weight recent documents higher
Feedback loop: Online learning from click-through data
A/B testing framework: Compare different embedding models
Explainability: Show why results match (highlight similar phrases)


Infrastructure & Scalability

Distributed search across multiple shards
Implement replica management for high availability
Support for GPU acceleration (FAISS-GPU)
Horizontal scaling with consistent hashing


Monitoring & Analytics

Track metrics:

Recall@k, Precision@k, MRR, NDCG
Query latency percentiles
Cache hit rates
Index memory usage


Implement drift detection for embedding quality
A/B test different retrieval strategies


API Design

pythonclass VectorSearchEngine:
    def search(
        query: str,
        k: int = 10,
        filters: Dict[str, Any] = None,
        boost_fields: List[str] = None,
        rerank: bool = True,
        explain: bool = False,
        timeout_ms: int = 1000
    ) -> SearchResults:
        pass
Implementation Constraints:

Use Rust/C++ for core search algorithms, Python for ML pipeline
Leverage existing libraries (FAISS, Annoy, NMSLIB) but understand internals
Implement custom distance metrics for domain-specific needs
Ensure thread-safety for concurrent searches
Support both batch and streaming indexing

Evaluation Criteria:

Semantic accuracy on domain-specific test sets
Query latency under various load patterns
Index size and memory footprint
Ease of integration and API usability
Robustness to adversarial queries

Bonus Challenges:

Implement learned indices using neural networks
Support for multi-modal search (text + image)
Zero-shot adaptation to new domains
Privacy-preserving search using homomorphic encryption
