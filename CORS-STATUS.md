# CORS Configuration Status

## Current Status (July 18, 2025)

### ✅ CORS is Working
- The backend at `https://talentprompt-production.up.railway.app` is correctly configured
- CORS headers are present and allow `https://promtitude.com`
- Preflight requests are successful (HTTP 200)

### ❌ Login Endpoint Issue
- The `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint returns 500 Internal Server Error
- This is NOT a CORS issue - the headers are correct
- The health check shows the service is running and database is connected

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Clear site data in DevTools > Application > Storage

2. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Check backend service logs for the 500 error details
   - Look for missing environment variables or database issues

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all variables in `railway-env-backend.txt` are set
   - Pay special attention to:
     - `SECRET_KEY` - Must be exactly 32 characters
     - `DATABASE_URL` - Should be automatically set by Railway
     - `FIRST_SUPERUSER` and `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`

4. **Run CORS Check**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-cors.sh
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Check Railway backend logs for the specific error causing the 500
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the database migrations have run (`alembic upgrade head`)
4. Check if the first superuser was created successfully

The CORS configuration is correct. The issue is with the backend application itself.
