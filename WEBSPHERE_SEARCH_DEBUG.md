# WebSphere Search Debug Report

## Issue Summary

The search functionality was not returning results for "WebSphere" queries. Investigation revealed:

1. **Chrome Extension Issue**: The ultra-clean extractor was NOT extracting skills from LinkedIn profiles at all
2. **Skills Array Empty**: Resumes imported via the chrome extension had empty skills arrays
3. **Search Working Correctly**: The backend search logic was functioning properly but had no skills data to search

## Root Cause

The `ultra-clean-extractor.js` in the chrome extension was missing the skills extraction logic entirely. The skills array was initialized as empty but never populated during profile extraction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Debug Logging to Search Service

Enhanced logging in:
- `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/search.py` - Added request/response logging
- `/backend/app/services/search.py` - Added detailed search execution logging
- `/backend/app/services/search_skill_fix.py` - Added skill condition creation logging

### 2. Fixed Chrome Extension

Added skills extraction to `/chrome-extension/content/ultra-clean-extractor.js`:

```javascript
// Extract skills
console.log('\n=== Extracting Skills ===');
const skillsSection = document.querySelector('#skills')?.parentElement;
if (skillsSection) {
  // Try multiple selectors for skills
  const skillElements = skillsSection.querySelectorAll('.mr1.t-bold span[aria-hidden="true"]') ||
                       skillsSection.querySelectorAll('[data-field="skill_name"]') ||
                       skillsSection.querySelectorAll('div[data-field="skill_card_skill_topic"] span[aria-hidden="true"]');
  
  skillElements.forEach(element => {
    const skillName = element.textContent.trim();
    if (skillName && !data.skills.includes(skillName)) {
      data.skills.push(skillName);
      console.log(`Found skill: ${skillName}`);
    }
  });
  
  console.log(`Total skills extracted: ${data.skills.length}`);
} else {
  console.log('Skills section not found');
}
```

### 3. Created Debug Tools

Added `/backend/scripts/debug_websphere_search.py` which:
- Checks total resumes in database
- Counts resumes with skills data
- Searches for WebSphere variations
- Identifies resumes with WebSphere in text but not in skills
- Provides option to fix missing skills

### 4. Added Debug Endpoint

Created `/api/v1/search/debug/search` endpoint that provides:
- Database statistics
- Skills data samples
- Search pattern testing
- SQL query visualization

## How to Fix Existing Data

### Option 1: Run the Debug Script

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/debug_websphere_search.py
```

This will:
1. Show diagnostic information
2. Offer to fix resumes with WebSphere in text but not in skills

### Option 2: Re-import Profiles

1. Update the chrome extension (reload it)
2. Re-import LinkedIn profiles that should have WebSphere skills
3. The skills will now be properly extracted

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Debug Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/debug/search?q=WebSphere" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

2. **Test Search**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "WebSphere", "limit": 10}'
   ```

3. **View Logs**:
   The enhanced logging will show:
   - Query variations being searched
   - Number of conditions created
   - Results found at each stage

## Search Implementation Details

The search service handles skills in multiple ways:

1. **JSON Array Search**: Searches within the skills JSON array
2. **Text Casting**: Casts JSON to text for pattern matching
3. **JSONB Operations**: Uses PostgreSQL's JSONB functions for element matching
4. **Skill Variations**: Handles case variations (WebSphere, websphere, WEBSPHERE)
5. **Fallback to Text**: Also searches in raw_text and summary fields

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Re-import any profiles that need WebSphere skills detected
2. **Short-term**: Run the fix script to update existing data
3. **Long-term**: Add validation to ensure skills are extracted during import

## Monitoring

To monitor skills extraction going forward:

1. Check chrome extension console logs during import
2. Use the debug endpoint to verify skills data
3. Monitor search logs for skill matching patterns
