Good morning, Aditya. Thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?

Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. I'm really excited about this opportunity to discuss the Junior Python Developer position at your company.

Excellent! Let's start with you telling me a bit about your current role at Xitadel CAE Technologies.

Sure! I've been working as a Junior Python Developer at Xitadel for about three years now. My primary responsibilities include developing automation scripts for CAE simulations, maintaining our internal tools built

particularly enjoyed working on projects that combine backend Python development with frontend React components.

That sounds interesting. Can you tell me about a specific project you're proud of?

Absolutely! One project I'm particularly proud of was developing an automated testing framework for our CAE simulation results. Previously, engineers had to manually verify simulation outputs, which was time-consuming

interface. The system reduced verification time by about 70% and caught several edge cases that manual review often missed.

Impressive! What Python libraries did you use for that project?

For the backend, I primarily used pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and matplotlib for generating visualization reports. I also implemented asyncio for handling concurrent simulation result processing. For the API layer connecting to our React frontend, I used FastAPI, which provided excellent performance and automatic API documentation.

Good choices. Now, let's talk about your experience with React.js and JavaScript. How do you handle state management in React applications?

In my current projects, I've worked with different state management approaches depending on the application complexity. For simpler components, I use React's built-in useState and useContext hooks. For our larger dashboard application, we implemented Redux for centralized state management. I've found that Context API works well for mid-sized applications, while Redux is better suited for complex state trees with multiple

Can you walk me through how you would optimize a Python script that's processing large datasets?

Of course! First, I'd profile the code to identify bottlenecks using tools like cProfile or line_profiler. Common optimization strategies I've used include: - Using vectorized operations with NumPy or pandas instead of loops - Implementing multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks or asyncio for I/O-bound operations

- For really large datasets, I've worked with Dask for distributed computing

nested loops with vectorized pandas operations and implementing parallel processing.

Excellent approach. I noticed you have experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Bosch Rexroth. What did you learn there?

My internship at Bosch Rexroth was incredibly valuable. I worked on IoT data visualization tools where I

importance of writing robust, production-ready code and following industry best practices. I also gained exposure

Great! Now, let's do a quick technical exercise. Can you explain how you would implement a simple REST API

Sure! I'd use FastAPI for this. Here's my approach:

from pydantic import BaseModel class DataModel(BaseModel): name: str value: float timestamp: datetime Then create the API endpoint: from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException app = FastAPI() @app.post("/data")

DataModel): try: # Validate and process the data # Connect to database - I'd use SQLAlchemy # Store the data return {"status": "success", "id": generated_id} except Exception as e: raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e)) I'd also implement proper error handling, logging, and potentially rate limiting for production use.

Good! How would you ensure this API is testable?

I'd implement unit tests using pytest and pytest-asyncio for async endpoints. I'd use dependency

I'd use TestClient from FastAPI to test the complete request-response cycle. I believe in maintaining at least 80% code coverage and would set up CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically.

Perfect. Last question - where do you see yourself professionally in the next 3-5 years?

I'm passionate about becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer with deep expertise in Python and modern JavaScript frameworks. In the next 3-5 years, I aim to lead technical projects, mentor junior developers, and contribute to architectural decisions. I'm particularly interested in working with AI/ML integration in web applications and would love to expand my skills in that direction while continuing to build scalable, user-friendly applications.

Thank you, Aditya. Do you have any questions for me?

Yes, I do! Could you tell me more about the team structure and the types of projects I'd be working on? Also, what opportunities are there for professional development and learning new technologies?
