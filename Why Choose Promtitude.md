## The Promtitude Advantage

### 1. Search Like You Think, Not Like a Database

**Traditional Tools (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday):**
```
(Java OR J2EE) AND (Spring OR SpringBoot) AND ("5 years" OR "6 years" OR "7 years") AND (AWS OR Azure) NOT intern
```

**Promtitude:**
```
"Find me a senior Java developer with 5+ years experience who has worked with Spring Boot and cloud platforms"
```

Our AI understands context, synonyms, and intent. It knows that "senior" implies experience, that Spring Boot is related to Java, and that AWS/Azure are cloud platforms.

### 2. AI Interview Copilot - Your Secret Weapon

While other tools offer basic video recording, Promtitude provides:
- **Live Transcription** - Never miss a detail
- **Real-time Coaching** - AI suggests follow-up questions as the interview progresses
- **Instant Skill Detection** - Automatically identifies technical skills mentioned
- **Smart Scorecards** - Generated based on actual interview content, not generic templates
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Understand candidate engagement beyond words

**No other recruiting platform offers real-time AI assistance during interviews.**

### 3. Modern AI Technology Stack
