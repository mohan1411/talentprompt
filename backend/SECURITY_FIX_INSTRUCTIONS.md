# CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - User Data Isolation

## Issue Fixed
Previously, users could see ALL resumes from ALL users when searching. This was a major privacy breach.

## Changes Made
1. All search operations now filter by user_id
2. Vector search includes user_id in metadata
3. All endpoints verify user ownership

## Required Action - Re-index Existing Data

### Local Development
```bash
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the reindex script
python scripts/reindex_vectors.py
```

### Production (Railway)
```bash
# SSH into Railway container or use Railway CLI
cd /app

# The script should already have access to production environment variables
python scripts/reindex_vectors.py
```

## What the Script Does
1. Re-indexes all resumes in Qdrant with user_id metadata
2. Verifies that user isolation is working correctly
3. Shows progress and any errors

## Verification
After running the script, test that:
1. Users can only see their own resumes when searching
2. Similar resumes only shows user's own resumes
3. Popular tags only shows tags from user's own resumes

## If You Have Issues
1. Check that Qdrant is running and accessible
2. Ensure DATABASE_URL and QDRANT_URL are set correctly
3. Check logs for any error messages

This fix is critical for user privacy and data security.
