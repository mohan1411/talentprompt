# Search Quality Improvements Summary

## Problem
When searching for "Senior Python Developer with AWS", candidates like William Alves (who has AWS but NOT Python) were ranking high in search results due to high semantic similarity scores.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Query Parser (`app/services/query_parser.py`)
- Extracts individual skills from search queries
- Handles skill aliases (e.g., "js" → "javascript")
- Identifies seniority levels and roles
- Supports multi-word skills

### 2. Tiered Skill Matching System
The search now uses a **3-tier system** that prioritizes skill completeness:

#### Tier 1: Perfect Match (100% skills)
- All required skills present
- Score boost: 1.3x multiplier
- **Always ranks above partial matches**

#### Tier 2: Partial Match (≥50% skills)
- Some required skills missing
- Score penalty: 0.4x multiplier (60% reduction)
- Example: William Alves with AWS but no Python

#### Tier 3: Poor Match (<50% skills)
- Most/all required skills missing
- Severe penalty: 0.3x multiplier (70% reduction)

### 3. Enhanced Sorting Algorithm
```python
# Sort by tier first, then by score within each tier
sort_key = (skill_tier, score)
```

This ensures:
- Candidates with ALL required skills ALWAYS rank above partial matches
- Even a lower-scoring perfect match outranks a high-scoring partial match

### 4. Search Quality Metrics (`app/services/search_metrics.py`)
- Tracks skill match ratios for each search
- Calculates quality scores (0-1 scale)
- Identifies and logs search quality issues
- Provides performance metrics

## Results

### Before Fix
```
1. William Alves (0.85) - Has AWS, missing Python ❌
2. Perfect Match (0.75) - Has both Python and AWS
```

### After Fix
```
1. Perfect Match (0.975) - Has both Python and AWS ✓
2. Other Perfect Match (0.845) - Has both Python and AWS ✓
3. Lower Perfect Match (0.715) - Has both Python and AWS ✓
4. William Alves (0.340) - Has AWS, missing Python (Tier 2)
```

## Technical Details

### Score Calculation
```python
# For perfect match (100% skills):
final_score = original_score * 1.3

# For partial match (50% skills like William):
penalty_factor = 0.2 + (0.5 * 0.4) = 0.4
final_score = original_score * 0.4

# For poor match (<50% skills):
final_score = original_score * 0.3
```

### Example: William Alves
- Original vector score: 0.850 (high due to "Senior Engineer" matching query)
- Skills: Has AWS, missing Python (1/2 = 50% match)
- Penalty applied: 0.850 * 0.4 = 0.340
- Result: Drops from potential #1 to #4, below all perfect matches

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/app/services/search.py` - Core search logic with tiered scoring
2. `/backend/app/services/query_parser.py` - Query parsing for skill extraction
3. `/backend/app/services/search_metrics.py` - Quality tracking and metrics
4. `/backend/scripts/generate_test_resumes.py` - Better test data generation

## Testing
Multiple test scripts validate the fix:
- `test_william_alves_fix.py` - Shows penalty calculation
- `test_tiered_search.py` - Demonstrates tiered ranking
- `validate_search_fix.py` - Comprehensive validation
- `test_search_quality.py` - Quality metrics testing

## Key Improvements
1. **Skill relevance prioritized** over semantic similarity
2. **Transparent scoring** with clear tiers
3. **Consistent results** - candidates with required skills always rank higher
4. **Quality metrics** to track search effectiveness
5. **Better test data** with realistic skill combinations
