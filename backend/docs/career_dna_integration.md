# Career DNA Integration in Progressive Search

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the integration of Career DNA analytics into the progressive search endpoint to ensure the enhanced stage includes career trajectory analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Progressive Search Service (`app/services/progressive_search.py`)

- **Added Import**: Imported `career_dna_service` from `app.services.career_dna`
- **Enhanced Stage 2**: Modified `_stage2_enhanced_results` method to extract and include Career DNA profile for each candidate
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch block to handle potential errors in Career DNA extraction
- **Logging**: Added logging to track Career DNA extraction for debugging

### 2. Progressive Search Endpoint (`app/api/v1/endpoints/search_progressive.py`)

- **SSE Endpoint**: Updated the Server-Sent Events endpoint to include career analytics data in the response:
  - `availability_score`
  - `learning_velocity`
  - `career_trajectory`
  - `career_dna`
  
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: Made the same updates to the WebSocket endpoint for consistency

### 3. Career DNA Service (`app/services/career_dna.py`)

- **Removed NumPy Dependency**: Replaced numpy operations with pure Python implementations to avoid dependency issues
- **Updated Similarity Calculation**: Rewrote cosine similarity calculation without numpy

## Career DNA Data Structure

The Career DNA profile includes the following information:

```json
{
  "pattern": "fast_track|deep_specialist|lateral_explorer|startup_builder|corporate_climber",
  "progression_speed": 0.0-1.0,
  "skill_evolution": "T-shaped|Pi-shaped|Comb-shaped|Generalist",
  "strengths": ["rapid_advancement", "versatile_skillset", "commitment_stability"],
  "unique_traits": ["technical_leader", "cross_industry_expertise"],
  "growth_indicators": ["leadership_growth", "technical_depth", "continuous_learning"]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1 (Instant)**: Basic keyword search returns immediate results
2. **Stage 2 (Enhanced)**: 
   - Hybrid search combines keyword and vector search
   - Career analytics are calculated for each candidate:
     - Availability score (likelihood to change jobs)
     - Learning velocity (how quickly they acquire new skills)
     - Career trajectory (promotion patterns, role changes)
     - Career DNA (comprehensive career pattern analysis)
3. **Stage 3 (Intelligent)**: AI-powered insights and explanations

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the integration:

1. `scripts/test_career_dna_integration.py` - Tests the progressive search endpoint to verify Career DNA is included
2. `scripts/debug_career_dna.py` - Tests Career DNA extraction locally

## Benefits

- **Better Matching**: Identify candidates with similar career patterns to your top performers
- **Hidden Gems**: Find candidates who may not have exact skills but show fast learning patterns
- **Culture Fit**: Match career trajectories to your organization's growth patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify candidates likely to stay vs. those who job-hop frequently

## Usage Example

When performing a progressive search, the enhanced stage will now include career analytics:

```javascript
// Frontend can now display career insights
const result = searchResults[0];
console.log(`Career Pattern: ${result.career_dna.pattern}`);
console.log(`Learning Speed: ${result.learning_velocity}`);
console.log(`Availability: ${result.availability_score}`);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Career DNA Matching**: Add endpoint to find candidates with similar career DNA to a target profile
2. **Team Composition**: Analyze team career DNA diversity for balanced hiring
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Use career DNA to predict candidate success in specific roles
